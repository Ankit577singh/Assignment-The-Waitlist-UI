# Waitlist UI – Internal Tools Access

This is a simple single page waitlist form made using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  
In this page user can request access to internal tools by giving business email and a reason.

Main purpose of this assignment was to follow UI rules and validation rules and handle everything from frontend only.

## What I Built

I created one page which has:
- Grey background
- One white card in center
- Title "Internal Tools Access"
- One email input
- One textarea for reason
- One submit button with text "Request Access Token"

After user submit valid form, the form is removed and user sees message: "You have been added to the queue."
